#Rack.View API

### 1. extend

To create a View class of your own, you extend Rack.View and provide instance properties,
as well options to be attached directly to the constructor function.

extend correctly sets up the prototype chain, so subclasses created with the bellow described way
can be further extended and subclassed as far as you like.
Example:

 ```
    var MyView = Rack.View.extend({
       tmpId: 'testTemplate', // template Id
       tmpPath: './testTemplate.html', // template path - unnecessary if template already exist in your index.html
       tagName: 'ul', // tagName of your view element
       id: 'some_id', // id attribute of your view element
       container: '#parent', // parent element for pushing your view
       className: 'some_class', // class attribute of your view element
       events:{
           'click li':'handler'
       },
       initialize: function(){
          this.model.watch('model', this.render, this);
       },
       handler: function(){...},
       beforeRender: function(){...}, // will be called before template render
       afterRender: function(){...} // will be called after template render
    });
 ```

 * Brief aside on super: JavaScript does not provide a simple way to call super â€” the function of the same name defined
 higher on the prototype chain. If you override a core function like set (get, unset, watch, unwatch, trigger),
 and you want to invoke the parent object's implementation, you'll have to explicitly call it, along these lines:
Example:

    ```
    var MyView = Rack.View.extend({
        ...
        initialize: function(){
            MyView.__super__.initialize.apply(this, arguments);
            ...
        }
        ...
    });
    ```

### 2. constructor/initialize

    new View([attributes])

When creating an instance of a view, you can pass in the initial values of the attributes, which will be available in
the view. If you want bind your model to view you should pass the model instance to your view constructor as object
with key "model",
See example:

     ```
        var myView = new MyView({model: new Model()});
     ```

 ### 3. el

 view.el

 All views have a DOM element at all times (the el property), whether they've already been inserted into the page
 or not. In this fashion, views can be rendered at any time, and inserted into the DOM all at once, in order to get
 high-performance UI rendering with as few reflows and repaints as possible.

 this.el will be created from the view's tagName, className, id and attributes properties. If none are set,
 this.el is an empty div, which is often just fine.

     ```
     var MyView = Rack.View.extend({
       tagName:'span',
       id: 'my_view',
       className:'my_view',
     });
     ```
